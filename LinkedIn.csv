Vision

Apolis Activism is an independent contemporary brand that began with dreams and thread. Three brothers — Raan, Shea, and Stenn Parton — created a unique bridge between commerce and sustainable development. Through their travels they discovered stories of struggle and survival from visionaries and activists for change. These experiences shaped their perspective, resulting in a union of ideal and action. They anchored this vision in the word Apolis, which translates as a “global citizen” — where there are no flags and no borders, humanity is our common cause and greatest priority.

The brothers started making garments in 2004 and began embroidering a trademark red stitch on each piece. The sign of relief and an icon for all global citizens committed to quality and change.

CitySearch, now a part of IAC, established the category of local online community directories. eToys demonstrated the tremendous potential for online consumer retail and became one of the most recognized brands during the early days of e-commerce. Overture Services, which began life as GoTo.com, was the first company to introduce the concept of paid search — the business model that powers the multibillion-dollar online search market.

Idealab continues to explore a range of technology frontiers. New models for improving the search experience are at the core of several companies currently growing inside of Idealab. Moving beyond the Internet, we have spawned companies with breakthrough technologies in robotics, renewable energy and automotive design and production among others. Idealab also continues to partner with leading venture capital firms and other strategic investors to provide the resources to maximize the potential of these companies.

In addition to capital, Idealab provides a full range of resources to infuse start-ups with the support they need to rapidly introduce innovative products and services.

The U.S. military defends the homeland, deters adversaries, and builds security around the world by projecting U.S. influence and working with allies and partners. In case deterrence fails, the U.S. military is prepared to fight and win decisively against any adversary.  

Headed by Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark T. Esper, the Department is not only in charge of the military, it also employs a topnotch civilian workforce. With more than 1.3 million men and women on active duty, and 742,000 civilian personnel, we are also the nation's largest employer. 

The Pentagon, headquarters of the Department of Defense, is one of the largest office buildings in the world. Built in 1941 by the U.S. Army, the Pentagon has 17.5 miles of corridors yet it takes only seven minutes to walk between any two points in the building. 

Department of Defense personnel are the backbone of America’s national security. They represent the diverse makeup of our nation and support not only those on active duty but also families, veterans, and retirees through education, training, and benefit programs. 

Anything you want to do – on land, sea, air, or space -- you can do in service to your nation by joining the Department of Defense. Search for Jobs and Internships at USAJobs.gov.

CJ CheilJedang is a core subsidiary that is in charge of the food and bioengineering departments of the CJ Group. It has led the development of the Korean food industry for the past 60 years, and contributed to the development of the bioengineering industry as the nation’s top general food company. After being launched in 1953 as CheilJedang, it started as a food ingredient company and extended its business to processed foods. In 2007, it split off from CJ Company and became independent to concentrate on the food and bioengineering fields. CJ CheilJedang‘s food department has achieved growth in the processed foods and ingredients sector, and the bioengineering department in the bio, bio-resource and pharmaceutical sector. We are striving to go beyond being number 1 in Korea to become a global leader.
 CJ CheilJedang will continue to grow and evolve in the food & bio sectors through the spirit of ONLYONE and develop into a global life culture company. 

CJ CheilJedang started with sugar, but based on its R&D capacities, it is now leading the development of new materials and ingredients.
 In the sweetener department, we developed xylose sugar, which reduces sugar absorption, and tagatose, which helps adjust blood sugar. The milling department launched a pan frying powder made of natural ingredients and various pre-mixed products such as brownie mixes and ice cream mixes to satisfy consumer needs. In addition, the oil department became the first in Korea to develop oil paper for chocolates using enzyme methods and fermented soybean films for feeds.

We believe the financial system has let down the very people who need it most.

There is a clear gap between those who can cheaply access finance and those who cannot access it at any price.

 At XPRS, our goal and our mission is to use technology to bridge that gap. We use the latest technology to efficiently connect small businesses with capital so that these businesses, the lifeblood of the American economy, can grow and prosper.

 We deliver small business loan application decisions in as quickly as 1 business day and funding in as quickly as 2 business days.

Created by Russell Harrison primarily as a consultancy and development company, Zebranet has become a market leader in online booking systems for all types of people.

Providing an end-to-end service is essential in the current market.  The client needs to be in constant contact with the same person to ensure that the project goes to plan.  Zebranet provides this having a combination of sales, technical and project management experience.

In the software market, system design can often change through the build process.  This is handled using a project framework built using elements of Prince2 in order to make sure the project doesn’t hit major delays or cost increases.  In the event that this may happen we encourage our clients to revisit the original scope, which we then work through together to find the right solution.

We work very closely with all our clients to make sure that we reach the right solution for them at the right price. All too often a client may not be 100% sure of what their exact needs are. We can guide you through the minefield that is software development. You can be sure of a friendly and straightforward explanation from us as, although we might be ‘techie’, we always communicate in plain English.

Zebranet has built up a framework of partner companies so that we are able to source and provide services throughout the IT market: From servers and network infrastructure, to web site design, hosting and system support.",The home of booking systems and experts in bespoke software solutions.,41.0,Computer Software,0-1 employees,,Privately Held,2009.0,"Renishaw, Sheffield,   GB",4.0,2.0,"Online booking systems, Online event management, bespoke software solutions, online ticketing & access, and SharePoint",

Developing flexible and affordable genetic testing that improves the everyday lives of those around us.
Founded in 2011, Fulgent began with two simple ideas; flexibility and affordability. Today, we strive to create the most effective and wide ranging tests on the market. All of this is done in the pursuit of bettering the everyday lives of our customers. We shine brightest when meaningful relationships, passion, and purpose come together.

Why Fulgent?
We are committed to working side-by-side with every one of our clients. This is essential to a strong and successful relationship and is our core way of doing business. We have collaborated with some of the top clinicians in our field who have assisted us in creating our panels, report formatting, and improvements to our website.
Our approach has always been simple: provide testing based on the specific needs of clinicians and their patients.

Customer Support
Our support philosophy has always been simple: answer our client's questions quickly and accurately. We do not have a receptionist or an automated system, we have a dedicated team of customer support staff that can answer a wide variety of questions, so you can spend more time with what is really important, patients.

Nations Lending is a private company, headquartered in suburban Cleveland, Ohio. Founded in 2003 by two mortgage industry professionals who knew they could treat customers and their employees better.
Our mission is to treat every customer like a person, not a number.  We’re not a bank – we don’t manage people’s money.  We do mortgages.  We invest in our customers, striving to help them achieve the dream of owning their own home when other lenders tell them it’s not possible – no matter the loan amount.  We specialize in FHA and VA loans, providing those home buyers with focused attention to detail.  
We are a great company because we have great people working for us.  We empower our employees to pursue their career goals by supporting their individual and creative ideas.  We support a diverse workplace and meaningful work-life balance.
We give back to the community – our employees generously give their time to a variety of causes where needs are most critical.
We are Nations Lending Corporation.

In case deterrence fails, the U.S. military is prepared to fight and win decisively against any adversary.  

Headed by Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark T. Esper, the Department is not only in charge of the military, it also employs a topnotch civilian workforce. With more than 1.3 million men and women on active duty, and 742,000 civilian personnel, we are also the nation's largest employer. 

The Pentagon, headquarters of the Department of Defense, is one of the largest office buildings in the world. Built in 1941 by the U.S. Army, the Pentagon has 17.5 miles of corridors yet it takes only seven minutes to walk between any two points in the building. 

Department of Defense personnel are the backbone of America’s national security. They represent the diverse makeup of our nation and support not only those on active duty but also families, veterans, and retirees through education, training, and benefit programs. 

Anything you want to do – on land, sea, air, or space -- you can do in service to your nation by joining the Department of Defense. Search for Jobs and Internships at USAJobs.gov.

The structure of Idealab has allowed us to test many ideas at once and turn the best of them into companies, attracting the human and financial capital necessary to bring them to market.

Many of these companies were among the first to introduce new business ideas to the market. CitySearch, now a part of IAC, established the category of local online community directories. eToys demonstrated the tremendous potential for online consumer retail and became one of the most recognized brands during the early days of e-commerce. Overture Services, which began life as GoTo.com, was the first company to introduce the concept of paid search — the business model that powers the multibillion-dollar online search market.

Idealab continues to explore a range of technology frontiers. New models for improving the search experience are at the core of several companies currently growing inside of Idealab. Moving beyond the Internet, we have spawned companies with breakthrough technologies in robotics, renewable energy and automotive design and production among others. Idealab also continues to partner with leading venture capital firms and other strategic investors to provide the resources to maximize the potential of these companies.

In addition to capital, Idealab provides a full range of resources to infuse start-ups with the support they need to rapidly introduce innovative products and services. Resources include office space and the accompanying office services, development and technology, product and graphic design, marketing, financial advice, human resources, competitive research, legal, accounting and business development support and services.

Apolis Activism is an independent contemporary brand that began with dreams and thread. Three brothers — Raan, Shea, and Stenn Parton — created a unique bridge between commerce and sustainable development. Through their travels they discovered stories of struggle and survival from visionaries and activists for change. These experiences shaped their perspective, resulting in a union of ideal and action. They anchored this vision in the word Apolis, which translates as a “global citizen” — where there are no flags and no borders, humanity is our common cause and greatest priority.

The brothers started making garments in 2004 and began embroidering a trademark red stitch on each piece. The sign of relief and an icon for all global citizens committed to quality and change.

It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.

Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.

The U.S. military defends the homeland, deters adversaries, and builds security around the world by projecting U.S. influence and working with allies and partners. In case deterrence fails, the U.S. military is prepared to fight and win decisively against any adversary.  

Headed by Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark T. Esper, the Department is not only in charge of the military, it also employs a topnotch civilian workforce. With more than 1.3 million men and women on active duty, and 742,000 civilian personnel, we are also the nation's largest employer. 

The Pentagon, headquarters of the Department of Defense, is one of the largest office buildings in the world. Built in 1941 by the U.S. Army, the Pentagon has 17.5 miles of corridors yet it takes only seven minutes to walk between any two points in the building. 

Department of Defense personnel are the backbone of America’s national security. They represent the diverse makeup of our nation and support not only those on active duty but also families, veterans, and retirees through education, training, and benefit programs.

We are creating a new type of business model– one that demonstrates that you can focus on a social mission and build a successful business at the same time. 

Our goal is to transform the social good ecosystem by enabling organizations to save time, money, and resources and connect with talented and passionate individuals who have the potential to become long term advocates. We facilitate high impact engagements connecting a vast network of professional volunteers to nonprofits and social enterprises who join our service through a financial commitment funded by a grantmaker or through their existing funds.
