We are Privo, an AWS Premier Consulting partner headquartered in Woburn, MA with expertise in AWS migrations and management, managed services/help desk, and cybersecurity.  Not only do we plan, build and optimize for our clients, but we also have a growing list of clients that rely on us for 24x7 monitoring and management of their AWS infrastructure. We combine deep AWS experience with a genuine joy for the work we do.  Working closely with great companies to solve their most important IT challenges is what gets us out of bed in the morning.  We are seeking people who are smart, charming, gritty, and anxious to learn; and we give them opportunities to learn new skills and go deeper with the ones they already have. If you are looking for a place to grow professionally, this is it. 
THE ROLE
We want you to help build our AWS Managed Services team.  We have a growing list of clients that rely on us for 24x7 monitoring and management of their AWS infrastructure.  But that’s not on all!  
Privo takes an “engineering first” approach to AWS account management, meaning we don’t sit our hands waiting for things to break.  In this position, you’ll take an active role in pushing the envelope in AWS to proactively improve a client’s infrastructure to be the best it can be.
There’s no such thing as “hands off” at Privo, and we only know one speed.  We have a strong emphasis on automation so a big part of this role is contributing to our automation scripts.  We automate everything!   Speed is key when you’re on the forefront.  If you’re a slow learner, or you prefer a more deliberate pace, you’ll probably be a little uncomfortable with the rate of learning and the breadth of new projects/clients.  However, if that sort of thing excites you, you’ll have an opportunity to be right on the cutting edge of cloud technology, growing your AWS skills faster than you could have imagined.
PRIMARY JOB RESPONSIBILITIES

Engage in AWS engineering work for clients via tickets submitted to the service desk as assigned
Be an AWS platform expert in the “core” infrastructure areas (VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, etc.)
Gain familiarity with Privo’s strategic AWS services (WorkSpaces, AppStream, ECS, CodeDeploy, etc.)
Deploy and maintain AWS infrastructure in client environments
Contribute to Privo’s codebase with CloudFormation, Terraform, or potentially other automation and scripting languages
Participate in an on-call rotation for emergency support issues
Acquire and maintain all 5 of the “core” AWS certifications (Solutions Architect - Associate, Solutions Architect - Developer, SysOps Administrator - Associate, Solutions Architect - Professional, DevOps Engineer - Professional)
Engage directly with clients via phone and video calls to offer guidance and complete tasks
Contribute to Privo’s ever-growing knowledge base
Dedicate roughly 65% of your time to engineering tasks
Be a consultant and proactively solve problems for clients beyond just “closing the ticket”
Work independently and as part of a team
Contribute positively to the kick ass Privo culture!

REQUIREMENTS

7+ years of IT infrastructure experience overall
3+ years of Linux system administration experience, particularly supporting 3-tier web applications
Alternatively, healthy exposure to general server administration (Windows, Active Directory, Linux, DNS, etc.) is great!
